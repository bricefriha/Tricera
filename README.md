## Tricera ðŸ¦• 
> (I know it's not a Triceratops emoji, but I can't find any, so give me a break)

Tricera is a package manager (sort of) for Deno, created to facilitate creating and managing code bases while keeping in mind that I may receive slur in my DMs from Deno fanboys.
This project is highly inspired by [Trex](https://github.com/crewdevio/Trex) but not as good, yet still maintained (until I leave the project gathering dust like all my other ideas)

## Documentation

### Setup
For starters, make sure you have Deno set up on your machine (duh).

#### Linux:
Just add a new alias for it
``` 
alias tricera='deno run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricefriha/Tricera/main/cli.ts'
```

#### Windows:
> use linux

### Create a project

If you (somehow) know how to name your project:
```
Tricera --create MyProject
```
> After that, drop me a DM letting me know how you manage to find names for your projects, because it's legit the hardest part of any project for me

If you are too lazy to find a name for your project:
```
Tricera --create
```
> But eventually, you'll have to name your project, you know, so how about you name it now instead of [postponing](https://open.spotify.com/track/1IMtCtSqlw3VJv3IvCxkaz?si=f3d8f0b1dc9c4620) everything and tell them life's got you

## Contribution
Thank you so much for considering helping me with this project. 
Good luck reading my code without losing all respect for me, tho.

> Don't worry, I'll create a contribution.md ... someday...
